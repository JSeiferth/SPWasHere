# Help summon Ether's Phoenix
[Ether’s Phoenix](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/ethers-phoenix-18fb7d7304bb) is a magical creature that rewards those who help build a world where impact = profit.
It is an evolving algorithm that ensures public goods and positive contributions are recognized and fairly rewarded. You can help summon and grow Ether’s Phoenix by contributing **data**, **models**, **metrics**, and **feedback** to improve how Retro Funding measures impact. 

Together, we can rewrite the rules, ensuring that those who create impact are fairly rewarded for it.
